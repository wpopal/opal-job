Installation
------------

`npm install gulp-add-src --save-dev`

Usage
-----
Works like `gulp.src`, but you can put it anywhere in your pipeline and it will append the given files
to the pipeline.

Example:
```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var addsrc = require('gulp-add-src');
var coffee = require('gulp-coffee');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

gulp.task('build', function () {
  return gulp.src('files/coffee/*.coffee')   // start with the .coffee files in the project
	.pipe(coffee())                          // compiles coffee script
	.pipe(addsrc('files/js/*.js'))           // we use addsrc to add our .js files to the mix
	.pipe(uglify())                          // we minify everything
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));                // and write to dist
});
```

If you want add SRC to begining of the SRC array, you can use `addsrc.prepend`.
Or if you want to add SRC to end of the SRC array, you can use `addsrc.append`.
Respectively instead of addsrc.

Example use addsrc.append and addsrc.prepend:
```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var addsrc = require('gulp-add-src');
var coffee = require('gulp-coffee');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

gulp.task('build.angular', function () {
  return gulp.src('files/coffee/*.coffee')          // start with the .coffee files in the project
	.pipe(coffee())                                 // compiles coffee script
	.pipe(addsrc.prepend('files/js/constants.js'))  // we use `addsrc.prepend` to add our .js files to begining of the SRC array
	.pipe(addsrc.append('files/js/conflict.js'))    // we use `addsrc.append` to add our .js files to end of the SRC array
	.pipe(uglify())                                 // we minify everything
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));                       // and write to dist
});
```

As an example, this would be useful if you wanted to merge your `bower` scripts with your app scripts. You'd need your `bower` scripts to maintain their order (the `bower` scripts themselves) and make sure they come before your app scripts. In this case, you'd use `addsrc.prepend`.

Because of the unpredicabilty of `addsrc` alone, it's recommended to use one of the append/prepend variants. The original is only left in place for legacy reasons.
